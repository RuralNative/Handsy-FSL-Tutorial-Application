ENTRY SCREEN

INTRO:
Entry Screen is the first Composable screen to load up upon initialization of the application.

PURPOSE:
Its main purpose is to direct the user to either the USER INTRO SCREEN or MAIN SCREEN depending on the type of user. For our initial case, its only concern is whether the user is NEW or OLD
If the USER is NEW, Entry Screen will direct the user to the User Intro Screen
If the USER is OLD, Entry Screen will direct the user to the Main Screen

COMPONENTS:
COMPOSABLE SCREEN (for the UI role)
- Holds the composable functions responsible for displaying UI
VIEW MODEL (for UI State/State holder roles)
- Holds Logic
STATE
- State component was not used, for the following reasons: (1) it has no UI State to concern with, and (2) Screen is concerned only of the logic required for determining where the User will be transitioned to depending on whether they are a NEW/OLD user.

PROCESS:
1. Initialized automatically upon application launch, since it is the entry point in the NavHostController.
2. Passes Hilt-injected ViewModel and two lambda functions parameters for Navigation to Screen composable().
3. Composable Screen uses the ViewModel's helper function to check if User is NEW or OLD and then, using the passed-on Navigation lambda functions as arguments of the said method, directs the user to either Main Screen or User Screen
