List object - list of Lessons fetched from AlphabetLesson and PhrasesLesson serves as the State of the Main Screen UI

MainScreenState
- Holds the list of LessonCards that can be rendered to the UI

LessonCardState
- Holds data used by LessonCard composable in UI, such as ID, LessonName, and LessonMediaResource

LessonCard Composable

- Create an empty LessonCard composable
- Pass in LessonCardData to LessonCard
- Nest a Column composable for LessonCard
- Nest an Image composable and a Text composable for LessonCard
- Pass in arguments of LessonCardData properties for the painter and contentDescription parameters of the Image composable
- Pass in arguments of LessonCardData properties for the text parameter of the Text composable

LessonColumn Composable
- Create LessonColumn Composable that takes List from UI State as parameter, and nests a LazyColumn composable.
- Pass in List argument from Lesson Column to LazyColumn item() data parameter

MainScreenUI Composable
- Use LessonColumn inside Main Screen Composable

FIRST
Convert raw data collected from the database into a readable data for UI to compose wit
1. ViewModel collects Flow<List> from AlphabetLessonRepository
2. ViewModel iterates each of the Lesson inside the collected List, and assign the attributes of each Lesson to the LessonCardState variable. This means that each iteration creates a single instance of LessonCardState which is then stored to a MutableList<LessonCardState>
3. Set value of the MainScreenState's AlphabetLessons property with the MutableList<LessonCardState>
4. Do the same for PhraseLesson property of UI state
