# UserIntro and DevsIntro

The UserIntro and DevsIntro Screens are responsible for user onboarding. For this specific set of screens, we have only one documentation file due to the simplicity and similarity of their functions and shall be considered as the introductory set of screens in further dev docs of the repository.

## Purpose

The UserIntro() provides a UI that allows the user to primarily set their user name. This user name will be used as necessary data to complete the UI of the HomeScreen().
