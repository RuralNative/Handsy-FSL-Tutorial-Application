# HANDSY Filipino Sign Language Tutorial Application with Hand Sign Recognition (AI)

## Description

Handsy is an Android-based mobile application that aims to provide an accessible reference of learning for people to learn how to use the Filipino Sign Language. With simple visual aids to learn how to read and sign the Filipino alphabet and basic phrases for communication and an additional AI-assisted feature of assessing the learnings of the user by letting them show their hand signals through their phone's camera and checking what hand sign, it aims to revolutionize how we can make our communities increasingly inclusive towards people that do not have the ability to communicate through verbal words.
